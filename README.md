# Football-stats
This is a football statistics website built with Angular 6+ as an assessment for Byteworks.

# Brief Description
This site has access to football data for 7 major football leagues, champions league inclusive from football-data.org.

# Libraries Used
SASS, Bootstrap were the libraries used for structuring and designing the site to be responsive.
- SASS was used to take advantage of nesting, variables and other functionalities it offers.
- Bootstrap was used in some parts of the site where it proved more time demanding if built from scratch. 

# Time Taken
It took three days to build this site to this stage and more modifications will continue.

# Difficulties
The only difficulty encountered was access to the given API (statsfc.com) for the assessment had issues, of which i made complaints through mail and no reply regarding that was recieved and with deadline approaching I had to use another API.

# Fuctionalities Proud of
The routing and responsiveness is the functionality i am most proud of.
